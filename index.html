        <p>The construction of the Red Fort started in the year 1638 and took almost ten years to complete in the year 1648. The fort was constructed when Shah Jahan shifted the capital from Agra to Delhi, and during that time, the fort was known as Qila-e-Mubarak. 
            The Red Fort is one the most famous historical places in India, contributing largely to historical tourism in India, and it is also one of the places where the president of India gives his annual speech on Independence Day. </p>

        <p>The Hawa Mahal was built by the ruler Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, and the upper part of the monument was shaped like that a crown because the ruler was a devotee of Lord Krishna. 

            Hawa Mahal is said to be the tallest building in the world without a foundation. The whole palace is a little curved but stands still due to its pyramidical shape. 
            
            As per legends, it is also believed that the reason for making several windows was for the ladies so that they looked outside as they were under constant ‘purdah’.</p>
